	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity is the amout of time taken by the program to execute and give final results, it shoud be less and as we optimise the code code.That is called efficient program.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> is the amout of memory taken by the program if we use array to store data program space complexity would be O(n).
